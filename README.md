Plan your road trips.
Add features to Google Maps, namely useful for _longer_ road trips. (e.g. travelling to a hackathon! ðŸ˜„)

### Features
- Restaurants that appear along the way (complete)
- Duration + distance of the ride (complete)
- Gas prices for the specified regions (semi-complete)

As of Dec. 29, Google has added all of the aforementioned features to Maps, making this app **completely** useless. lol gg
