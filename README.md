# Plan
Plan your road trips.
Attempted to add further functionality to Google Maps, namely for road trips.

### Features
- Restaurants that appear along the way (complete)
- Duration + distance of the ride (complete)
- Gas prices for the specified regions (semi-complete)
- Outlet malls + attractions along the path
- Function to split costs

_As of DEC 29, Google has added all of the aforementioned features to Maps, making this app **completely** useless._ lol gg

### Technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Semantic UI (frontend) + HTML/CSS/JQuery
- [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.ca/developers/documentation/v2/overview)
- [Google Direction API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions)
- [Google Geocode API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding)
